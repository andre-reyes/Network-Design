# Network Design course at UML SU23
Network design course repo for Summer 2023

## [Phase 1](Phase%201/)
The TCP/IP stack has five layers, namely application, transport, network, link, and physical. In Phase 1 of the project, each student has to individually implement the standard user datagram protocol (UDP) sockets. The intention is to transfer a message (Say “HELLO”) from the UDP client to the UDP server and then  ECHO the message back from the UDP server to the UDP client. Note that the client and server process can reside on the same host, but have to use different port numbers.  Make sure that your program can send and receive messages in both directions.
  - [x] UDP sending  
  - [x] UDP recieving

## Purpose of the phase

## Code Explanation
![imports.png](images/imports.png "Imported Libraries")
![main.png](images/main.png "Main Function")
![server.png](images/server.png "Server Function")
![client.png](images/client.png "Client Function")
* The client function is similar to the server function but does so in the opposite order.
* After the client socket is made, it waits for user input, once user input is found, it sends the data through the assigned address and port for the server socket
* it then listens to a response from the server, once a response is heard it isn't the quit value, it outputs a string with the echo/info
![initiateMain.png](images/initiateMain.png "Initiate main")
* This if statement at the end of the file ensures that main() is run and is needed to run script directly.

## Execution Example
